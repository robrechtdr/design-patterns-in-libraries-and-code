## Factory (Creational)





## Template method (Behavioural)

The template method pattern is about leveraging a class with a 'template method'
which does some kind of setup process using other of its methods which are 
meant to be overwritten for customization.

So simply inheriting from a class with some methods is not sufficient to talk about the Template method pattern, it's only when we rely on the 
core setup mechanism from that parent class that we talk about this pattern.


## Python Example - Django's CBV 





the 'Template class' to  


Template Method pattern outlines the general steps in the parent class and lets the concrete child
implementations define the details.




Template method:
```
df.apply(...)
df.groupby(...)
